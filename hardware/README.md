# Hardware
Minimal needs are:
1) A ESP32 compatible board (A ESP32 module is just fine e.g.: https://www.az-delivery.de/en/collections/esp32/products/esp32-d1-mini)
2) A power supply. ESP32 modules have normally a USB connector where power can be connected. Or use a small PS like this https://www.az-delivery.de/en/collections/stromversorgung/products/copy-of-220v-zu-5v-mini-netzteil
3) A ACS712 current sensot. A module is fine like this one: https://www.az-delivery.de/en/collections/sensoren/products/acs712-5a
4) Some piece of PCB (Lochraster) some wires and a soldering iron.
